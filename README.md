# Space Travel App
Space Travel App simulates an application where simplified space journeys can be managed.

## Users
Users are split into three different categories, each having different rights:
- TRAVELERs can sign up for journeys (they need to pay for each signup and their proposal needs to be accepted)
- GUIDEs approve travelers proposals for each journey and can also create a propposal for new journey
- OWNERs approve guides propposals (after proposal is accepted, guide pays the owner for it)
